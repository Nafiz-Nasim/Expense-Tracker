# Expense Tracker

A simple and interactive Expense Tracker application built using HTML, CSS (via TailwindCSS), and JavaScript. This project allows users to manage their finances by tracking their balance, adding money, and recording expenses. It also provides a history feature to view previous transactions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can enter their name and initial balance upon first visit.
- **Balance Management**: Users can add money to their balance and track the remaining amount.
- **Expense Tracking**: Users can add expenses by entering the title and amount. The app will deduct the expense from the available balance.
- **History Tracking**: Users can view the history of their added money and expenses with details like title and amount.
- **Responsive Design**: The app uses TailwindCSS for a responsive, mobile-friendly design.

## Languages and Tools Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the application is built using HTML.
- **CSS**: TailwindCSS is used for styling, providing a modern and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used for the app's functionality, including data handling, user interaction, and storage.
- **Local Storage**: User data, such as name, balance, and history, is stored in the browser's local storage to persist between sessions.

## How It Works

1. Upon loading the app, users are prompted to enter their name and balance.
2. After entering these details, the user is taken to the main section where they can:
   - Add money to their balance.
   - Record expenses by entering an expense title and amount.
   - View their balance and expense history.
3. Data is saved in local storage, so users' details persist even if they close the app or reload the page.
4. Users can check the history of their expenses and deposits by clicking the "History" button.
